/**
 * This code was written by Martin Wattenberg and has long been in the public domain.
 * <P>
 * The BufferPanel is a panel that paints itself
 * using an offscreen buffer, but only redraws the offscreen buffer
 * when explicitly told to do so.
 * <P>
 * Caching the offscreen image is useful for situations
 * where rendering the offscreen buffer takes a long time
 * and re-rendering each time repaint() would be inefficient.
 * <P>
 * The key public method for this panel is <code>redraw()</code>,
 * which forces an update of the offscreen buffer and then draws
 * to the screen.
 * <P>
 * The key protected method, which subclasses should override,
 * is <code>drawOffscreen(Graphics g)</code> where all
 * rendering code should be placed.
